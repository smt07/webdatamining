## E-commerce, Online Shoppers Purchasing Intention

### Introduction
This dataset comprises 18 attributes, including 10 numerical and 8 categorical ones. It provides valuable insights into user behavior on an e-commerce site.

### Numerical Attributes
- **Administrative**: Number of administrative pages visited.
- **Administrative Duration**: Total time spent on administrative pages.
- **Informational**: Number of informational pages visited.
- **Informational Duration**: Total time spent on informational pages.
- **Product Related**: Number of product-related pages visited.
- **Product Related Duration**: Total time spent on product-related pages.

### Google Analytics Metrics
- **Bounce Rate**: Percentage of visitors who enter a page and leave without further interaction.
- **Exit Rate**: Percentage of pageviews that were the last in the session.
- **Page Value**: Average value of pages visited before completing a transaction.

### Special Day Attribute
The "Special Day" attribute indicates the proximity of visits to specific special days, affecting transaction likelihood.

### Other Attributes
This dataset also includes information about:
- Operating system
- Browser
- Region
- Traffic type
- Visitor type (returning or new)
- Boolean value indicating weekend visit
- Month of the year

### Class Label
The "Revenue" attribute serves as the class label, indicating whether a transaction was completed which mean a Sale, No Sale, customer did not purcase anything during the session.

### Algorithms 
I have used three diffrent algorithm to find out their result with metrics, F1 score, accurucy, Recall and Presicion. Based on these result user can find out which model to choose from. 
Desicion Tree classifier, Random Forrest Classifier and Naive Bayes Classifier have been used for this project. 

### Conclusion
This dataset provides a comprehensive view of user interactions on an e-commerce platform, offering valuable insights for analysis and prediction tasks. 

In this project, I have worked independently, utilizing various machine learning models to predict future results. The objective is to explore different algorithms, optimize their performance, and present the outcomes of each method. 

By experimenting with different approaches, I intend to gain insights into user behavior on e-commerce platforms and develop predictive models that can effectively anticipate purchasing intentions.
